## ADABORD: a novel Adaptive Boosting approach for Ordinal classification
In this repository we provide the source code of the ADABORD method proposed in [*incoming*]. Moreover, we provide the code to reproduce the experiments in the paper, as well as the code to load the datasets used in the experiments.

:closed_book: ADABORD is implemented in `adabord.py` and `adabord_base.py` files.

:blue_book: The experiments are implemented in the `experiments.py` file. The remaining files implement the baseline methods used in the experiments.

:computer: More about ordinal classification can be found in the [dlordinal package](https://github.com/ayrna/dlordinal), where several ordinal techniques are implemented, together with the most popular ordinal performance metrics.
